* I _don't_ have access to Websubmit anymore, and can therefore not tell you what grades I got on the individual assignments.
* I _don't_ take any responsibility for incorrect solutions to any of the problems.
* _Don't_ just copy my answers, because you're not gonna learn anything. If you're stuck, look at them for guidance and figure out why it is what it is.
