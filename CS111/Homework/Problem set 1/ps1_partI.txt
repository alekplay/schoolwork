Problem set 1 - Part I - Aleksander Skjoelsvik

1:
Task a:
i. The following expressions produce an error message:
	'xyz'
	'\'
	'//'

ii. The error type is "lexical"

Task b:
i. I get the following numbers:
	'd' = 100
	'e' = 101
	'f' = 102
	'D' = 68
	'E' = 69
	'F' = 70
	'0' = 48
	'1' = 49
	'2' = 50

ii. The letters following each other makes sense, as their number is one bigger than the one before. When 'd' is 100, it makes sense that 'e' is 101. But I can't find any relationship between for example 'd' and 'D'.

iii. I get the following characters:
	97 = 'a'
	80 = 'P'
	63 = '?'
	('A' + 1) = 'B'
	('A' + 2) = 'C'
	('A' + 3) = 'D'

iv. These will produce the letter 'G'
	(char)('A' + 6)
	(char)('D' + 3)
	(char)('F' + 1)

2: 
Task a:
public class MyProgram{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This code is problematic!");
        System.out.println("Can you get it to compile?");
    }
} 

Task b:
The following are not valid identifiers:
	class  - (cannot be the same as a keyword)
	total value - (cannot contain a space)
	7dwarfs	- (cannot start with a number)

Task c:
The following series of println statements produce the lines indicated in the assignment:
	System.out.println("///\\\\\\ \\\\// /'\\");
        System.out.println("\"Hi\", said Perry.  \"What's new?\"");
        System.out.println("\"Not much\", said Libby. \"What's new with you?\"");

3:
The program will produce this output:
	hello
	hello
	bye
	hello
	see ya
	hello
	bye
