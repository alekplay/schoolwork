(p and q) and r, s and tÂ 		|- q and s
		---
Proof: 	1. (p and q) and r		Premise
		2. s and t				Premise
		---
		3. p and q 				(eliminating r)
		4. q					(eliminating p)
		
		5. s					(eliminating t)
		---
		6. (q and s) are both true, so the problem is true
		

p, (p implies q), p implies (q implies r) 		|- r
		---
Proof:	1. p implies (q implies r)				Premise
		2. p implies q							Premise
		3. p 									Premise
		---
		4. q implies r							(eliminating p from 1 because of 3)
		
		5. q									(eliminating p from 2 because of 3)
		
		6. r									(eliminating q from 4 because of 5)
		---
		7. r is true, so the problem is true
